My name is 林欣諴
I will introduce visible benefits of working out. 
There are many advantages for working out.
Like have good shape、prevent disease、 delay aging、and enhance cardiopulmonary function.
And now, I will start from having good shape.
First, In Taiwan, there are about 45.4% people who are classified as overweight people.
Just like the person in the picture.
It is very terrible because nearly half of people in Taiwan are fat, that means when you see two people on the street, one of them is overweight.
However, if a person start to  work out, he will be good looking and he will be strong.
So, working out is very useful when you want to have good shape.
Then, working out can also prevent disease because it can make the immune system in your body greater.
Thus, it can kill bacteria and virus more easily and make your body healthier.
After that, you will not get a cold easily.
Therefore, if you want a healthy body, working out is a good choice for you.
Third, working out can delay aging because it can enhance muscle content and promote your metabolsim, which will make you look younger.
Moreover, it can also let your digestive system more powerful, and it is also good for your health.
Last but not least, working out can enhance cardiopulmonary function because after a lot of training, it can make the muscle of your heart stronger, which means the ability of delivering oxygen will become better.
Furthermore, it can also let the lung absorb oxygen more, so you will not feel out of breath easily after exercising.
Generally speaking, working out is good for your body.
